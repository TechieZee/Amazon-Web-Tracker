# Amazon-Web-Tracker

##This project implements a web scraper using selenium web driver that
gets to the URL to the amazon.in website and gives back the data like Price, Product id,
Link, name of the product by different sellers.
â€¢ This web scrapper cannot be detected by amazon as I filtered the URL for each search. All
the retrieved data gets stored in the json file
